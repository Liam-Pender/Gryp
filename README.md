# Gryp

Hello and welcome to Gryp, My final project designed to be a
climbing taskmanager/checklist and log tracker.

Running the app:
There are 2 recomended ways to run the app, Via expo, or through
the online Snack.

Note. It is recommended you have the Location settings turned on
on your phone.

Snack:

1. go to the following web address https://snack.expo.dev/@liampender/gryp
2. either run a simultor or scan the QR code provided and run the
   app on your phone expo go app.

Note - if you are running the app via a simulator on snack I would
recommend using an IOS simulator, when making a new log the app will
try to get your location, if you chose to allow it, and it can be problematic
on android simulators but has no issue on a real android.

Expo:

1. go into the "Gryp" folder,
2. run "expo start"
3. scan QR code or run simulator
